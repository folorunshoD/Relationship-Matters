   <article class="latest" >
   <p class="latest"> How can the will of  God be frustrated? 
    Has God shown you that brother or sister? You have prayed,fasted,confirmed and already agreed to be in relationship. 
    According to myles Munroe God created us for management. Anything you don't  manage you loose even if its Gods will,spoken
    by an angel. Samson lost his place. John lost his head .Manange that relationship well.</p>

 <p class="number" > Note</p>
   <p >  What you dont manange you loose.</p>
    <p class="number"> #1</p>
    <p class="latest">The spec of the man or woman you are looking for does not exist!
    Note
    But in Gods will you will find rest, You will not eat what will kill you. Thaose wh  spec I want has killed many ladies and silenced many destiny
    turned many men to those who sleep with harlots. Infact injure destinies.
    Beware!
    Ehn he his not as spiritual as I am,She is not as spiritual as I am...
    Please do you have a spiritual meter? That person who dosent shout in tongues may be deep down there.(some words from Daddy Gbile Akanni).
    And if  not, is he or she born again?
    At least more than a year(according to Daddy Gbile Akanni,Someone born again two months cannot be classified as a christian- are you sure he did not come for you instead coming for Jesus?)
    </p>                                 <p class="number"> # 2</p>
<p>  Or you are already in the relationship as a sister, and you start seeing more light than him. You now become mummy word. Before he quote 1 scripture you give him two? Sister your level is now high.
Don't forget many people are out there without any relationship and just with the snap of fingers they'll collect him from you. Come that is the reality that trash to you is a treasure to someone else. You will loose him.
Brother build your babe. Help and support her</p>
                                                   <p class="number"> #3</p>
                                                    <p class="latest"> Submission.Come submission does not start in marriage. Submission starts with your male friends around. Are you humble and broken? Come to think of it, number one any lady who is not submitted to God can not submit to a man! 
Your power is your submission, such as peace is a strength against Violence.
Be broken. Spiritual ladies your wisdom is corrupted, you are so gullible to some feminist messages. If he doesn't call, you don't call him. Don't do this, don't do that. I am not asking you to become a half wife before you be a wife.
 Submit in words and in action.
 To a man, Love is submission.</p>
                                <p class="number">#4</p>
 <p>   Every man wants peace. 
Come lets think of it. Who doesn't want peace? No sensible man will want his house on fire. Any small thing small fight. Every now and then quarell . Its of a  truth that fight at times brings us close and helps to know each other better. But must it be that frequent? Please give his mind peace. A man who lacks peace is dangerous to himself and his mission.

                                                    <p class="number"> #5</p>
 <p class="latest">Never forget where you started from.
It is of a truth that love grows cold. This was what my mentor told me. What keeps a relationship is Vision, God and reflections.
Your purpose keeps you strong and bonded together. It is the engine room, the reason you both live and die for. God, your prayer life, your fellowship and walk with God. Reflections, where did you start from- was it chatting , exchanging of letters, midnight calls. Whatever you started with, go back to it. You'll be able to keep the love alive again.
