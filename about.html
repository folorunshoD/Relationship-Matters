   <p class="latest">As the second son and child in a family of 8 (4 boys and 2 girls), I have learnt to take on responsibility for my actions and those of my siblings. 
    Although my parents are constantly working hard, to ensure that we are comfortable and we have good education, there was a time I still had to sell yam from street to street, to meet daily needs and support my family. I am the first graduate in my family. I have always had a flare for achieving greatness anywhere I find myself. With the grace of God, I always take everything I do seriously with a determined mind and I did wonderful when I had the opportunity to get a degree with the steadfast support of my parents. I value and love music and this has led me to write a few songs. I was able to participate in a Nescafe competition, although I couldn’t win, I gave it my all. I was also opportune to serve God in a Christian fellowship during my service year as the music director. I ventured into web design during my service as a way to learn something new and be of value to my community   . With this skill, I was able to proffer a solution to a citizen of my country who needed a website. I was also able to create a Christian blog where ideas about creation can be posted for the consumption of others. Asides from all these I have a calling and a vision. I love teaching and passing knowledge to others and this led me, by God’s direction to start a school. A  school which will add value to the education sector of my country. During my service year, I passed knowledge to the younger generation in 2 different schools with an extra tutorial class for a child who needed it. Teaching isn’t all about re-reading the books back to those willing to learn but it also entails ensuring, in the best way possible that the information is understood. I also teach the word of God to people. Teaching is something I love to do. In order for me to be able to pass knowledge, 
    I believe I’ll need to understand who I’m teaching and how knowledge can be passed on to them. 
    
    Thank you.</p>
