   <article class="latest" >
   <p class="latest"> Popularly called Michael. My name is Folorunsho Michael Damola finished from University of Ilorin where I studied Chemistry Education. As the second son and child in a family of 8 (4 boys and 2 girls), I have learnt to take on responsibility for my actions and those of my siblings. 
   I am the first graduate in my family. I have always had a flare for achieving greatness anywhere I find myself. I believe I’ll need to understand who I’m teaching and how knowledge can be passed on to them. 
    
    Thank you.</p>
